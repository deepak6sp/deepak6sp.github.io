I am a Web Developer having 4+ years of experience mainly focusing on UI and
Front end development. I develop with skills of minimal usability designs and
using core XHTML/HTML, CSS and Javascript. My coding follows reusable component
based structure for easy maintenance, scaling and debugging. I also have experience
using PHP and Node frameworks.

I love blogging and to share my knowledge that focuses mainly on latest web technologies involving Javascript and Node. However, I would also like to include tips and tricks about UX/UI, front end and back end technologies
