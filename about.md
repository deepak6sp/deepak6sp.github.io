I am a Web Developer having 4+ years of experience, mainly working on UI and
Front end development. I develop with skills of minimal usability designs and
using core XHTML/HTML, CSS and Javascript. My coding follows developing reusable components (TDD) and domain based structure for easy maintenance, scaling and debugging. I also have experience using PHP frameworks (laravel & codeigniter), Node framework (expressjs)
and CMS (wordpress & shopify).

I love blogging and to share my knowledge that focusing mainly on latest web
technologies involving Javascript and Node. However, I would also like to
include tips and tricks about UX/UI, front end and back end technologies.
